//AJAX stuff. from 'create' action in comments controller. here we have a new_comment mssage, prepend
//a new review from a product before the other commments. average rating from raty stars ratings

$("#new_comment").html("thanks for your thoughts! :D"); //show message confirming comment is ok.
//The 'j' method call is used to escape the Ruby code inside our JavaScript. Because we named the partial
// _comment.html.erb inside our views/comments folder, we can just use Rails' short form @comment.
$(".product-reviews").prepend("<%= j render @comment %>");
$("#average-rating").attr("data-score", "<%= @product.average_rating %>");
