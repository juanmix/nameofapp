  end

end

# initialize method takes in a user object as a parameter. so permissions
# can be modified based on any user attribs.
# :manage is the action to the argument 'can'. :manage matches any action on
# the 'User' controller, so any user can manage (perform action) with a user object.
# The second parameter is the restriction, meaning that the user must have the same
# ID as his or her User record does, i.e., the user can manage his or her self.


    # Define abilities for the passed in user here. For example:
    #
    #   user ||= User.new # guest user (not logged in)
    #   if user.admin?
    #     can :manage, :all
    #   else
    #     can :read, :all
    #   end
    #
    # The first argument to `can` is the action you are giving the user
    # permission to do.
    # If you pass :manage it will apply to every action. Other common actions
    # here are :read, :create, :update and :destroy.
    #
    # The second argument is the resource the user can perform the action on.
    # If you pass :all it will apply to every resource. Otherwise pass a Ruby
    # class of the resource.
    #
    # The third argument is an optional hash of conditions to further filter the
    # objects.
    # For example, here the user can only update published articles.
    #
    #   can :update, Article, :published => true
